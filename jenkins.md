### 1. What is the difference between Freestyle and Pipeline jobs in Jenkins?

- **Freestyle projects** are configured through **Jenkins’** web UI. You define build steps using form fields, which makes them simple and straightforward for small, simple projects.
- **Pipeline jobs** use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on Groovy, typically defined in a file called a **Jenkinsfile**. Pipelines support complex workflows including multiple stages, parallel execution, error handling, and conditional logic.

**Jenkins Pipeline** offers two syntaxes:

- **Declarative Pipeline**: Provides a more structured and opinionated syntax, making it easier to define common pipeline stages.
- **Scripted Pipeline**: Offers full flexibility with Groovy scripting, which is useful for more complex, dynamic workflows.

---

### 2. How can sensitive information such as passwords be protected in a Jenkins?

- **Jenkins Credentials Plugin**: to store passwords, tokens, SSH keys, and other secrets securely.
- When using **Jenkins Pipelines**, you can leverage the **withCredentials** block to inject secrets as environment variables temporarily. This ensures they aren’t exposed in the logs or build output

---

### 3. What is the Credentials Plugin in Jenkins used for?

The **Credentials Plugin** in **Jenkins** is designed to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, API tokens, SSH keys, and certificates.

---

### 4. What is the basic purpose of a Jenkinsfile and why is it used?

- a **Jenkinsfile** is used to codify and automate the entire CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that your build processes are consistent, transparent, and easily manageable.
- A **Jenkinsfile** is essentially a text file that defines a **Jenkins** pipeline as code. Its primary purpose is to describe the steps, stages, and overall process of your CI/CD workflow in a structured, version-controlled format.

---

### 5. How would you distribute Jenkins Pipeline execution to multiple agents?

- we can distribute pipeline execution to multiple agents by directing specific stages or steps to run on designated nodes using labels. This is typically done by specifying the agent for each stage in a **Declarative Pipeline** or wrapping steps in a **node** block in a **Scripted Pipeline**.

- we can define a pipeline with no global agent, and then assign an agent to each stage:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none  // No global agent
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent { label 'build-agent' }
            steps {
                echo "Running build on build-agent"
                // Add build steps here
            }
        }
```

For scripted pipelines, you use the **node** block with a label:

```groovy
node('build-agent') {
    echo "Running build on build-agent"
    // Build steps
}
```

**Parallel Execution**  
If you want to run tasks concurrently on different agents, you can leverage the **parallel** directive:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Parallel Tasks') {
            parallel {
                stage('Task 1') {
                    agent { label 'agent-1' }
                    steps {
                        echo "Task 1 running on agent-1"
                    }
                }
```

---

### 6. What is the concept of an agent in Jenkins?

- In **Jenkins**, an **agent** is like a worker machine that runs your build, test, and deployment tasks.
- This helps distribute the workload and speeds up your CI/CD process.

---

### 7. Can the same machine on which Jenkins is installed also function as an agent?

Yes, the same machine where **Jenkins** is installed can also serve as an **agent**. By default, **Jenkins** allows jobs to run on its master node, effectively letting it act as an agent. However, it's often recommended to use separate agent machines for build tasks in larger or more secure environments to avoid overloading the master and to enhance security.

---

### 8. How do you implement parameterization in Jenkins?

- **Parameterization** in **Jenkins** lets you pass inputs to your jobs at runtime, making builds flexible and customizable  
  Use the **parameters** block at the top of your **Jenkinsfile**. For example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'USERNAME', defaultValue: 'guest', description: 'Enter the user name')
        booleanParam(name: 'DEBUG', defaultValue: false, description: 'Enable debug mode')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Username: ${params.USERNAME}"
                echo "Debug Mode: ${params.DEBUG}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 9. How do you archive artifacts when using an Artifactory repository in Jenkins?

- When archiving artifacts with an **Artifactory** repository in **Jenkins**, we typically use the **Jenkins Artifactory Plugin** to integrate your build with Artifactory. This allows you to automatically upload (or "archive") your build outputs to a managed repository.
  1. **Set up the Artifactory plugin** in **Jenkins** and configure your Artifactory server details in the **Jenkins** global settings.
  2. **Define an Upload Specification**:
     - Create an upload spec (a JSON-formatted file or string) that tells the plugin which files to pick up (using patterns) and where to place them in Artifactory (the target repository and path).

---

### 10. On which programming language is the project you're currently working built?

The project is built using **JavaScript** within the **Node.js** ecosystem. We leverage **Node.js** and **npm** for building and testing, and our pipeline uses **Next.js** for bundling the **React** application, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Webpack** (via **Next.js**) for optimizing our **JavaScript** code. Additionally, our testing commands (`npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage`) run within a **Node.js** container, likely using frameworks like **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **Jasmine**, along with **ESLint** for code quality and **Istanbul** (or **Jest coverage**) for test coverage.

In our pipeline, we are using **Node.js** and **npm** (**Node Package Manager**) as the build tool to test the code. The testing is done using `npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage` within a **Node.js** container.

🔹 **Summary**  
🚀 **Build tool used for testing**: **Node.js + npm**  
🛠 **Testing frameworks likely used**: **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **Jasmine**  
🔍 **Code quality tool**: **ESLint**  
📊 **Coverage tool**: **Istanbul (nyc) / Jest coverage**

Your project uses these build tools:  
✅ **Next.js** (`next build`) for **React** application bundling  
✅ **Tailwind CSS** (`npx tailwindcss`) for styling  
✅ **Webpack** (via **Next.js**) for optimizing **JavaScript**  
✅ **cross-env** for setting environment variables

### 11. What is the concept of Jenkins Shared Library?

it is also a **DRY** priciple which a **DevOps Engineer** follow  
A **Jenkins Shared Library** is a way of defining reusbale code that can be strored in a a centralized repository and can be used across multiple pipelines.  
We can write common code, functions, blocks from the classes in one shared library and make use of in the pipeline by calling them like `@Library('my-shared-library') _`  
- This approach improves consistency, maintainability, and collaboration across projects

---

### 12. How do you implement parallel stages in Jenkins Pipeline?

- **Parallel stages** in **Jenkins Pipeline** allow you to run multiple tasks simultaneously using **parallel** block/directive, reducing overall build time and improving efficiency

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Parallel Tasks') {
            parallel {
                stage('Task 1') {
                    steps {
                        echo "Executing Task 1"
                        // Add steps for Task 1 here
                    }
                }
                stage('Task 2') {
                    steps {
                        echo "Executing Task 2"
                        // Add steps for Task 2 here
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 13. What is the purpose of the "agent" keyword in a Jenkins pipeline?

The "agent" keyword in a **Jenkins pipeline** specifies where your pipeline (or specific stages) will run. It tells **Jenkins** which node, container, or environment to use when executing your build, test, or deployment steps. You can define it globally for the entire pipeline or individually for each stage, allowing you to distribute tasks across different environments as needed.

---

### 14. Have you heard of "pipeline as code"?

defining our pipeline in code based using **Jenkinsfile** is called as **pipeline as code** that lives alongside your source code.

---

### 15. What are the differences between Declarative and Scripted pipelines in Jenkins?

**Declarative Pipeline**: Uses a structured, predefined syntax (enclosed in a `pipeline {}` block) that is easy to read and write. It enforces best practices and provides clear sections like **agent**, **stages**, **steps**, and **post**.  
**Scripted Pipeline**: Based on Groovy, it offers full flexibility with an imperative style, allowing you to write custom logic but with less built-in structure.  
**Declarative Pipeline**: Ideal for most common CI/CD tasks where a standard structure is sufficient.  
**Scripted Pipeline**: Useful when you need advanced customizations or dynamic behavior that doesn’t fit within the Declarative model.

---

### 16. Have you implemented a Jenkins pipeline triggered by a webhook?

---

### 17. How do you handle failed jobs in Jenkins and troubleshoot them?

Yes, I have implemented **Jenkins pipelines** triggered by **webhooks**. Typically, this involves configuring your source control system (such as **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**) to send webhook notifications to your **Jenkins** server. When a commit or pull request is made, the webhook sends a payload to a designated **Jenkins** endpoint (e.g., `/github-webhook/` for **GitHub**), which then triggers the pipeline defined in your **Jenkinsfile**. This setup enables automated builds and tests on every code change, streamlining the CI/CD process.

---

### 18. What is the purpose of the SonarQube step in Jenkins?

The **SonarQube** step in **Jenkins** is used to run a static code analysis on your codebase. This step triggers the **SonarQube scanner**, which evaluates your code for quality issues like bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and maintainability problems. The results are then sent to the **SonarQube** server, where they are aggregated and displayed on a dashboard, often with quality gate thresholds that can influence whether a build passes or fails. This integration helps ensure that only code meeting your defined quality standards moves through your CI/CD pipeline.

---

### 19. How does SonarQube check code quality?

**SonarQube** checks code quality by performing static analysis on your source code. **SonarQube** provides developers with a comprehensive view of code quality, helping to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

---

### 20. Who set up SonarQube with the pipeline, you or someone else?

The integration was a collaborative effort, but the primary setup was handled by our **DevOps** team. I assisted by incorporating the necessary steps into the **Jenkins pipeline** (like adding the **SonarQube** step to the **Jenkinsfile**), but the configuration and integration of **SonarQube** with our CI/CD system was managed by someone with specialized expertise on our team.

---

### 21. What does "code coverage" mean in SonarQube?

**Code coverage** in **SonarQube** refers to the percentage of your source code that is executed when your tests run. It’s a measure of how much of your code is actually being tested by your automated tests. **SonarQube** reads the coverage reports (generated by tools like **Jest coverage** or **Istanbul/nyc**) and then displays this metric on its dashboard. This helps identify untested areas of your code, guiding you to improve test quality and overall code reliability.

---

### 22. What is a blue-green environment, and how can you achieve it in Jenkins?

A **blue-green environment** is a deployment strategy that minimizes downtime and risk by running two identical production environments—one "blue" (current live version) and one "green" (new version). When it's time to release an update, you deploy the new version to the idle environment (**green**), perform tests and verifications, and then switch the traffic over from **blue** to **green**. This method allows for quick rollbacks if needed and ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

---

### 23. scenario in which there is one server and we have installed jenkins in it, everything is working fine because of some reason scaling or something we have to pick everything from one server and push it to other server jenkins, how can we do that?

- we can migrate your entire **Jenkins** installation—including jobs, plugins, configurations, and build history—from the current server to a new one. The most common method is to back up and restore your **Jenkins home** directory  
  1. **Backup the Jenkins Home Directory (JENKINS_HOME)** (contains all your job configurations, plugin data, and other settings).
  2. Stop the **Jenkins** service before creating the backup. This prevents any changes during the backup process.
  3. Transfer the backup file or directory to the new server using secure copy methods like **scp** or **rsync**.
  4. Set up **Jenkins** on the new server, ensuring the version you install is compatible with the backed-up configuration and plugins.
  5. Replace the new server's **JENKINS_HOME** with the backup from the old server.
  6. Once the restoration is complete, start **Jenkins**. Verify that all jobs, plugins, and configurations are intact and functioning as expected.

---

### 24. Do you know how to create a master slave/agent architecture?

- Yes, I do. In **Jenkins**, you can create a **master-agent** (formerly known as master-slave) architecture to distribute the workload of running jobs across multiple machines  
  1. **Set Up the Jenkins Master**: Install **Jenkins** on your primary server. This master node is responsible for orchestrating jobs, managing configurations, and delegating tasks.
  2. **Prepare the Agent Machines**: Ensure that the machines you want to use as **agents** have **Java** installed, as **Jenkins agents** require it. They don't need to have **Jenkins** installed; only a **Java** runtime is necessary.
  3. **Configure Agents on the Master**: we can Create a new node (agent) by going to **Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → New Node**. we can specify details to there like lables, remote directory and etc. Choose a launch method via **SSH**.

---

### 25. when you creating master slave you look for fill the executors? do you know what is the number of executors?

- Yes, I do. In **Jenkins**, an executor is essentially a “build slot” on a node (whether master or agent) that determines how many jobs can run concurrently on that machine.
- Too many executors on a machine with limited resources can lead to contention, while too few might underutilize available capacity.
- When setting up a **master-agent** (slave) architecture, plan and configure the executors on each node based on the expected workload. You can adjust this in the node’s configuration within **Jenkins**.

---

### 26. what kind of jobs you created is it a declartive or scripted pipeline or normal job? what have you done?

I've primarily implemented **Declarative Pipelines** in our **Jenkins** setup. This approach allows us to define our entire CI/CD process in a clear, version-controlled **Jenkinsfile** with structured stages and steps. That said, for more dynamic scenarios that require complex logic, I have also used **Scripted Pipelines**. Additionally, I've configured some freestyle jobs for simpler tasks where a full pipeline wasn't necessary. Overall, the emphasis has been on using **Declarative Pipelines** for their readability, maintainability, and ease of integration with source control.

---

### 27. Do you have multi branch pipeline created? why do we need this?

Yes, I have set up **multi branch pipelines** in **Jenkins**. They are essential because they automatically discover branches in your repository that contain a **Jenkinsfile**, creating a separate job for each branch. This means that whenever a new branch is created or updated, **Jenkins** can automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments for that branch  
- **Automatic Branch Discovery**: No manual job creation is needed for each branch.
- **Isolation**: Each branch is built and tested independently, reducing interference between development streams.

---

### 28. how do you pass parameters to your job?

whenever we run the pipeline we can give inputs to the job by using parameters.  
Define Parameters in the **Jenkinsfile**:  
You include a **parameters** block at the beginning of your **Jenkinsfile**. For example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'BRANCH', defaultValue: 'master', description: 'Git branch to build')
        booleanParam(name: 'RUN_TESTS', defaultValue: true, description: 'Run tests after build?')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building branch: ${params.BRANCH}"
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            when {
                expression { return params.RUN_TESTS }
            }
            steps {
                echo "Running tests..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Access Parameters:  
Use the **params** object (e.g., `params.BRANCH`) to reference the parameters within your pipeline stages.

---

### 29. what do you understand by a trigger?

A trigger in **Jenkins** is an event or condition that automatically initiates a build or pipeline run, eliminating the need for manual intervention. There are two common mechanisms for triggering builds  
- **Push-Based Triggers**: These use webhooks from your source control system (like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**) to notify **Jenkins** as soon as a commit or pull request is made. The push mechanism sends the information directly to **Jenkins**, which then starts the corresponding job immediately.
- **Pull-Based Triggers**:  
  In this method, **Jenkins** periodically polls the source control repository to check for changes. If new commits are detected, **Jenkins** triggers the build. This method doesn't require an external notification but instead relies on **Jenkins** checking the repository at regular intervals.
- **SCM Changes**:  
  **Jenkins** can poll your source code repository or respond to webhooks (like **GitHub** or **GitLab triggers**) when code is pushed or a pull request is made.
- **Scheduled Builds**:  
  Using cron-like syntax, you can schedule builds to run at specific times.
- **Upstream Job Completion**:  
  A job can be triggered automatically when a dependent job finishes successfully.

---

### 30. How to resolve broken pipeline issue in Jenkins?

to identiy the issue  
1. we can watch Pipeline Logs.  
2. Validate the **Jenkinsfile** Syntax  
3. Review Recent Changes:  
4. Rollback to a Stable Version if needed.

---

### 31. Explain common cicd setup?

- There are many **CI tools** available in the community, I will consider **Jenkins** to answer this.
- **CI/CD** is a process of **continous integration** and **continous delivery**, in the current organisation we use **GitHub** as a source code repository.
- we have configured a **GitHub webhook** that triggers **Jenkins pipeline** on every commit, the **Jenkins pipeline** set up with mulitple stages:
  - **Build stage** - take care of static code analysis, Unit test and build
  - **Test** - running smoke and functional test
  - **Deploy stage** - push artifacts to the repository, prepare the deployment mainfests and deploy on **k8s cluster**.

---

### 32. Explain your current cicd setup?

1. when starting wrting **Jenkinsfile**, if we needed we can write global variable before pipeline block to use them anywhere in the pipeline.
2. then inside the pipelinse block we start defining **options** block which consists of **buildDiscarder**, **ansiColor**,**timeout** config.
3. **environment** block we can define all the necessary variable in this block to parameterization
4. **agent** block with is label name
5. and stages started which includes  
	1. **checkout**  
	2. **Test and Build** (Runs parallel stages for unit testing (with linting, building, and test execution) and dependency fetching/building **Docker images** (using **Kaniko**))  
		for linting we use **ESLint**, for building the app we use **Next.js** using `npm run build` command, testing framkework we use **jest** and **mocha** by running `npn run test`, to coverage the code `npm run test:coverage` using **jest** framework.
	3. **stage deploy**: Has separate parallel stages for pull request deployments, staging, and production. It also includes rollback stages for production if needed.
- we use **parallel** directive to deploy the image accross different envs using **when** and expressions below is the example

```groovy
stage('Deploy'){
	parallel {
		stage('Pull Request'){
			steps {
				script {
					deploy//
				}
			}
		}
		stage('staging'){
			steps {
				when {
					anyOf {
					  expression { env.CHECKOUT_BRANCH == 'main' }
					  expression { params.deployStagingBranch == true }
					  expression { params.deployTagToStaging == true }
					}
				}
			}
		}
		stage('Deploy Production'){
			steps {
				script {
					deploy (env.APP_NAME_PUI,env.BRANCH_NAME,env.IMAGE_TAG_PUI,gitCommitShort,env.K8S_TOKEN,env.PRODUCTION_EKS,env.NEW_RELIC_TOKEN,env.ENV,env.GIT_COMMIT,env.NEW_RELIC_APP_ID,env.CHECKOUT_BRANCH)
			}
		}
		stage('Rollback Production'){
			steps {
				script {
                rollbackToVersion (env.APP_NAME_PUI, env.ENV,  env.IMAGE_TAG_PUI, env.GIT_COMMIT, env.K8S_TOKEN, env.PRODUCTION_EKS, env.NEW_RELIC_TOKEN, env.CHECKOUT_BRANCH, env.NEW_RELIC_APP_ID)
              }
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Post-Build Actions**: Notifications, **GitHub PR** comments, and semantic release steps are incorporated.

- Also we use **shared libraries** (like `"jenkins-agent@stable"` and `"jenkins-shared-library@stable"`) to centralize common logic, which keeps our **Jenkinsfile** clean and maintainable.

---

### 33. How do you  backup and scaling up Jenkins servers?

**JENKINS_HOME Backup**:  The core of **Jenkins** data (jobs, configurations, plugins, credentials, build logs) resides in the **JENKINS_HOME** directory. Regularly back up this directory using tools like **tar**, **rsync**, or file system snapshots.

**Containerization & Orchestration**:  Deploy **Jenkins** (or parts of your pipeline) in containers managed by **Kubernetes** or similar orchestrators. This allows dynamic scaling of agents based on load and offers better resource utilization.

**Dynamic Scaling**:  **Kubernetes** can monitor the load on your agents and automatically spin up new containerized agents when there’s high demand, and then scale them down when idle. This is done using mechanisms like the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** and **Cluster Autoscaler**. This means you only use the resources you need when you need them.

---

### 34. How do you manage plugins in a Jenkins environment to ensure stability?

- Keep a record of installed plugins and their versions
- Regularly update plugins in a dev/staging environment before rolling them into production.
- Limit installations to only those you need, reducing potential conflicts and attack surfaces.
- Regularly back up your **Jenkins home** directory (**JENKINS_HOME**), which includes plugin data and configurations, so you can restore to a known stable state if needed.

---

### 35. How do you design a Jenkins pipeline to support multiple environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod)?

- Our pipeline is designed to support multiple environments by leveraging a modular deployment stage that uses the **parallel** directive.
- In the "**Deploy**" stage, we have separate parallel stages for pull request deployments, staging, and production.
- Each of these stages is conditionally executed using **when** expressions based on the environment or specific parameters.
- Additionally, we include rollback stages for production to ensure that if any issues occur during deployment, we can quickly revert to a stable state.
- This structure allows us to deploy the image concurrently across different environments while maintaining the flexibility to handle environment-specific logic and rollback scenarios when needed.

---

### 36. How can you handle dynamic branch creation in Jenkins pipelines?

By setting up **multi-branch pipelines** in **Jenkins**. They are essential because they automatically discover branches in your repository that contain a **Jenkinsfile**, creating a separate job for each branch. This means that whenever a new branch is created or updated, **Jenkins** can automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments for that branch.

---

### 37. How do you ensure pipeline resilience in case of intermittent failures?

**Timeouts and Fail-Fast**:  
Set appropriate timeout limits for stages so that hung processes don't block the pipeline indefinitely. Using the **failFast** option in parallel stages helps abort the entire branch if one critical task fails.

---

### 38. How do you enforce role-based access control (RBAC) in Jenkins?

**Role Strategy Plugin**:  
This plugin provides a more flexible way to define global roles (e.g., **admin**, **developer**, **viewer**) and project roles. You can assign these roles to users or groups, ensuring that users have access only to the parts of **Jenkins** they need.

---

### 39. How do you integrate Jenkins with Docker for building and deploying applications?

We integrate **Jenkins** with **Docker** by using **Kaniko** rather than the **Docker** or **Docker Pipeline** plugins. In our pipeline, a dedicated **Kaniko** container is used to build and push **Docker images** securely. **Kaniko** runs without requiring a **Docker daemon** or privileged access, making it ideal for containerized environments like **Kubernetes**. This approach ensures that our builds are reproducible, secure, and fully integrated into our CI/CD process without the risks associated with traditional **Docker-in-Docker** setups.

---

### 40. what is kaniko?

**Kaniko** is an open-source tool developed by **Google** that builds **container images** from a **Dockerfile** without requiring a **Docker daemon**. It runs inside a container (or on **Kubernetes**) and executes the commands in your **Dockerfile** to produce an image. Because it doesn't need privileged access, **Kaniko** is a secure option for building images in cloud-native CI/CD pipelines, particularly in environments like **Kubernetes** where running a **Docker daemon** might not be feasible or secure.

---

### 41. How do you integrate Jenkins with a Kubernetes cluster for deployments?

- we can Use the **Kubernetes plugin** or **kubectl** commands in the pipeline.
- but in my organisation We integrate **Jenkins** with **Kubernetes** by configuring our pipeline to run on dynamic, ephemeral **agent pods**. Our **Jenkinsfile** uses the `kubernetes` directive to spin up pods that have the necessary tools (like **kubectl**) for deployments. Secure credentials and environment variables are set for each cluster (e.g., staging, production), so our deployment steps can communicate with the **Kubernetes API** to update deployments, apply changes, and perform rollbacks. This setup automates and streamlines our deployment process directly from **Jenkins** to our **Kubernetes** cluster.

---

### 42. how do you create webhook to trigger your jenkins pipeline?

We use **Smee client**. The **Smee client** deployments act as a relay for **GitHub webhooks**. They listen for events from **GitHub** (via smee.io URLs) and forward those payloads to your **Jenkins** master's webhook endpoint (e.g., `http://jenkins-server/github-webhook/`). This setup triggers **Jenkins** jobs based on **GitHub** events.

---

### 43. How can you reduce the build time of a Jenkins job?

 Use **parallel stages** to execute independent tasks simultaneously.  
 Example: Parallelize static code analysis, unit tests, and integration tests.  
 Use build caching mechanisms like **Docker layer caching** or dependency caching using a package cache

---

### 44. How do you optimize Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines with heavy test loads?

 Use **parallel stages** to execute independent tasks simultaneously.  
 Example: Parallelize static code analysis, unit tests, and integration tests.  
 Use build caching mechanisms like **Docker layer caching** or dependency caching using a package cache  
**Caching and Incremental Builds**:  
Cache dependencies and build artifacts so that repeated tests don’t need to re-download or rebuild everything. Additionally, run only affected tests when changes occur.

**Resource Allocation**:  
Allocate sufficient CPU and memory resources for test agents. Use autoscaling (e.g., **Kubernetes HPA**) to dynamically scale test agents based on demand.

---

### 45. What would you do if a Jenkins job hangs indefinitely?

 Check the **Jenkins build logs** for deadlocks or resource contention.  
 Restart the **agent** where the build is stuck, if needed.  
 Example: A job stuck in **docker build** could indicate **Docker daemon** issues; restart the **Docker service**.  
**Kill and Restart**: If necessary, manually abort the job, then try to reproduce the issue with more debugging information to pinpoint the cause.  
**Set Timeouts**:  Add timeouts (using the **timeout** step in a pipeline) so that the job automatically aborts if it runs longer than expected, preventing indefinite hangs.

---

### 46. How do you troubleshoot a Jenkins job that keeps failing at the same step?

**Review the Logs**: Examine the console output and error messages in detail.  
**Retry Mechanisms**: **try block** or **failFast** set to true  
**Increase Logging or Debug Mode**:  Add additional logging around the failing step or enable debug mode for more verbose output. This can help pinpoint exactly where and why the failure occurs.  
**Resource and Environment Check**:  Confirm that the **agent** running the job has sufficient resources (CPU, memory) and that the network or external service it depends on is accessible.  
**Isolate the Step**:  Run that step in isolation, if possible. For example, if it’s a shell command or script, try running it manually on the **agent** or in a similar environment to see if it fails outside of **Jenkins**.

---

### 47. How do you implement manual approval gates in Jenkins pipelines?

```groovy
input {
                message "Should we continue?"
                ok "Yes, we should."
            }
```

---

### 48. How do you handle blue-green deployments in Jenkins?

 Create separate pipelines for **blue** and **green** environments.  
 Route traffic to the new environment after successful deployment and health checks.  
 Example: Use **AWS Route53** or **Kubernetes Ingress** to switch traffic seamlessly.

---

### 49. How do you monitor Jenkins build trends?

 Use the **Build History** and **Build Monitor** plugins. **Blue Ocean UI plugin** and **pipeline stage view plugin**, **Test Results Analyzer Plugin**, **Dashboard View Plugin**,  
 Example: Visualize pass/fail trends over time to identify flaky test 

---

### 50. How do you notify teams about build failures?

- Use the **post** section in your **Jenkinsfile** to trigger notifications when a build fails.
- Leverage plugins like the **Email Extension Plugin**, **Slack Notification Plugin**, or **Microsoft Teams Connector**. These plugins allow you to configure message formats, recipients, and channels for alerts.
 Use the **Email Extension** or **Slack Notification** plugins.  
 Example: Configure a **Slack webhook** to notify the `#build-alerts` channel upon failure.

---

### 51. How do you trigger a Jenkins pipeline from another pipeline?

- we can trigger one **Jenkins pipeline** from another using the built-in **build** step. This step allows you to call another job (which can also be a pipeline) and optionally pass parameters or wait for its completion.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Trigger Downstream Pipeline') {
            steps {
                build job: 'downstream-pipeline-job', wait: true, parameters: [
                    string(name: 'PARAM_NAME', value: 'value')
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 52. How do you implement conditional logic in Jenkins pipelines?

- Use the **when** directive to conditionally execute stages based on branch names, environment variables, or custom expressions in your **Declarative Pipeline**  
- Use standard Groovy **if/else** statements to control the flow of your **Scripted Pipeline**:.

---

### 53. What would you do if a Jenkins master node crashes?

**JENKINS_HOME Backup**: Restore the **Jenkins home directory** from a recent backup, which includes all job configurations, plugins, and build histories.  
**Restart**: First, try to restart the **Jenkins** service. Sometimes a simple restart can resolve temporary issues.  
**Check Logs**: Review **Jenkins** logs to understand the root cause of the crash and address any underlying issues.

---

### 54. How do you restart a failed Jenkins pipeline from a specific stage?

To restart a failed **Jenkins pipeline** from a specific stage, go to  

**Blue Ocean UI**:  If you’re using a declarative pipeline and have **Blue Ocean** enabled, you'll often see a "Restart from Stage" button when a build fails. This lets you pick the stage where the failure occurred, so you don't have to rerun the entire pipeline.

- we can also add **Checkpoints Plugin**, Each checkpoint creates a restart point with the given name.
- the **Checkpoints Plugin** works with **scripted pipelines**. Declarative pipelines might not support this feature directly.

---

### 55. How do you implement parallelism in Jenkins pipelines?

⚫ Use the **parallel** directive in declarative pipelines or **parallel** block in scripted pipelines.  
⚫ Example: Run unit tests, integration tests, and linting in parallel stages.

---

### 56. How do you run Jenkins jobs in a Docker container?

⚫ Use the **docker** block in declarative pipelines.  
Example: 

```groovy
agent { 
docker { image 'node:14' } 
}
```

---

### 57. How do you integrate Jenkins with AWS for CI/CD?

- we use the **AWS Credentials Plugin** to securely store and inject **AWS access keys** into our jobs Then, using steps like **withAWS()** or we can also give  **AWS CLI** commands directly in our pipeline.
- the the pipeline can execute **AWS CLI** commands to interact with services like **ECR** (for pushing Docker images), **EKS** (for deploying Kubernetes workloads).

---

### 58. How do you schedule periodic builds in Jenkins?

we can schedule periodic builds in **Jenkins** by configuring a **cron** trigger either through the **Jenkins job configuration** or directly in your **Jenkinsfile**  
usng **triggers** block.

---

### 59. How do you audit build logs and job execution in Jenkins?

⚫ Enable the **Audit Trail** plugin to track user actions.  
⚫ Example: View changes made to jobs, builds, and plugins.

---

### 60. How do you manage build artifacts in Jenkins?

⚫ Use the **archiveArtifacts** post-build step.  
⚫ Example: Store JAR files and logs for future reference using `archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'build/*.jar'`.  
**Use Artifact Repositories**:  For long-term storage and better management, integrate with artifact repositories such as **JFrog Artifactory**, **Nexus**, or **AWS S3**. Plugins like the **Artifactory Plugin** allow you to automatically upload artifacts from your builds to these repositories, which is ideal for versioned release artifacts.

---

### 61. How do you publish artifacts to a repository like Nexus or Artifactory?

To publish artifacts to a repository like **Nexus** or **Artifactory**, you typically use dedicated plugins or deployment scripts within your **Jenkins pipeline**

Example: Push a JAR file to Nexus with: 

```sh
'mvn deploy'
```

---

### 62. How do you integrate Jenkins with a database for testing?

⚫ Spin up a database container or use a preconfigured test database.  
⚫ Example: Use **Docker Compose** to bring up a **MySQL** container before running tests.

---

### 63. How do you manage long-running jobs in Jenkins?

Break them into smaller jobs or stages to allow checkpoints use **parallel stages**.  
**Set Timeouts**:  
Configure timeouts for stages or steps using the **timeout** directive. This prevents any single part of the job from hanging indefinitely.

---

### 64. What would you do if Jenkins pipelines start failing intermittently?

⚫ Investigate resource constraints, flaky tests, or network issues.  
⚫ Example: Monitor agent logs and rebuild affected stages.

---

### 65. How do you manage Jenkins jobs for multiple branches in a monorepo?

⚫ Use **multibranch pipelines** or branch-specific **Jenkinsfiles**.

---

### 66. How do you handle cross-team collaboration in Jenkins pipelines?

⚫ Use **shared libraries** for reusable code and maintain a central **Jenkins** governance team.

---

### 67. How do you manage Jenkins agents in a dynamic cloud environment?

**Dynamic Provisioning**:  We use cloud-specific plugins (like the **Amazon EC2 plugin**) or the **Kubernetes plugin** to automatically launch and terminate **Jenkins agents**. This allows agents to be spun up only when builds are queued and shut down when they’re no longer needed.

**Autoscaling**:  Integration with auto-scaling mechanisms (like **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** or cloud auto-scaling groups) ensures that the number of agents adjusts dynamically with the build demand, optimizing cost and resource utilization.

---

### 68. How do you limit the number of concurrent builds for a Jenkins job?

- `disableConcurrentBuilds()` only one build at a time executes, if we can run two builds at a time the first one executes and the second one will wait for the first one to complete and once completed then second build starts.
- Use the **Throttle Concurrent Builds** plugin.

---

### 69. How do you optimize Jenkins for large-scale builds with limited hardware?

1. **Distributed Build Agents**: Offload Workloads distribute your builds across multiple agents  
2. **Caching and Incremental Builds**: Cache build dependencies, artifacts, and **Docker layers** to avoid redundant downloads and rebuilds  and Configure your pipelines to rebuild only the parts of the codebase that have changed  
3. **Resource Management and Throttling**: `disableConcurrentBuilds()`
4. **Parallel Execution**: Break your pipeline into stages that can run in parallel  
5. **Timeouts and Fail-Fast** - Timeouts to prevents any single part of the job from hanging indefinitely and **Fail-Fast** stop further processing as soon as an error is detected `failFast True`  
6. **Container Orchestration**: Leverage containerized agents which can scale based on the current load

---

### 70. How do you implement custom notifications in Jenkins pipelines?

we can implement custom notifications in **Jenkins pipelines** by:

Adding **Post-Build Steps**:  Use the **post** section in your **Jenkinsfile** to send notifications on build outcomes.

Using **Notification Plugins**:  Integrate with email (using **Email Extension**), **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, etc., by adding their respective steps.

Employing **Custom Scripts**:  Write your own notification scripts (e.g., using `curl` to trigger webhooks) for more tailored messages.

**Conditional Logic**:  Use Groovy scripting to send different notifications based on build results (success, failure, etc.).

---

### 71. How do you alert stakeholders only on critical build failures?

**Identify Critical Failures**: Determine criteria that mark a build failure as critical.  
**Implement Conditional Logic**: Use pipeline post actions or plugin-specific settings to trigger alerts only when these criteria are met.
